This page is essential to branding and success for livestreamers.

When making changes to the alerts page, ensure

1. Testing on older versions of OBS at least 5 years old. Most streamers do not update their OBS and we should not expect them to update to be compatible with pogshop.
2. All changes are done using a css or scss file. Tailwind is not compatible for all versions of OBS.

Case study:
In 2025, @dalcompeach was a twitch streamer who joined pogshop and was unable to play alerts after her first sale. This was because not all versions of OBS support tailwindcss.
